# Magic Bean
This is a small maze game developed with Pygame. The game idea took a little inspiration from the fairytale "Jack and the Beanstalk" (although we just call it 魔豆 (*Magic Bean*) in China), and a little inspiration from the underground levels in the classical Super Mario. The player just needs to control the character by typing in certain commands, to find a way up on the ground, where the wonder seeds can grow. 
Here is a demo video of the game play: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BCeuMHreKDtcuZiy4AxTc8i6JUmgXvri/view?usp=drive_link
